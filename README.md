## Usage

![build-a-burger](public/assets/img/burgerpage.png)

When you navigate to the page, there will be a textarea that you can use to build your burger. When you hit "Build my burger!", the burger will be created and placed on the left side of the screen, along with a 'DEVOUR BURGER' button. If you press this button, the burger will be moved to the right side of the screen, indicating that it has been devoured.
